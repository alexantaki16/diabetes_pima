Welcome to my Pima Native American Project from Kaggle!

I will keep this README short since the notebook has all of the juicy detail, but it notebooks are not your thing well here is the run down

##This is the notebook that will serve as the analysis and model building of the Pima Native Americans datasets from Kaggle.

<h3>Goals of this project</h3>
- Develop a strong structure to follow, as in a framework so I have the ability to use this a guide for future projects.

- Commit to GitHub so I can track my progress

- Foster my intuition on which plots are the best for certain types of data

- Standardize and normalize data quickly

- Feature Engineering ideas?

- Practice modularizing my code to make it easier to use
